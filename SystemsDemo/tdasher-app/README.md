# TDasher Demo

A minimal Vite + React app containing your `TDasher` component.

How to run:

1. Open a terminal in the project folder `tdasher-app`.

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Run dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

4. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:

- This project uses `lucide-react` for icons. If you prefer not to install it, you can remove the icon imports and placeholders in `src/TDasher.jsx`.
- Tailwind CSS is not configured here; the component uses inline styles so it renders without Tailwind.
